# 360-latent-attention-stream
* model for predicting omnidirectional (head and eye movment) for  360 frames in encoder decoder design, leveraging spatial fixations the Coarse model used as latent module for extracting global attention learned directly from 360 static characteristics , in this project we implement three different architectures .   

* Work still in progress
